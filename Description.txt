In this Project ,  i mentioned the information regarding the Training and Test datasets. I also analysed the Data using Pandas library . Visualization of data is done using matplotlib and seaborn.
 Later on i removed  all the data that was not in numerical form or have missing data.Imputing of data is done to fills missing values using SIMPLE IMPUTER.
Parameter tuning was done with use of GridSearchCV which evaluated model for all combination of algorithms specified in a grid. GridSearchCV helped me find out the best parameters for our model.
i used XGBoost Regressor to predict the data since it supports both regression and classification predictive modelling problems.It helped me increase the accuracy of my model.
